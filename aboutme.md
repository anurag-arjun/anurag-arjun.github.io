I am a Product Manager for a SaaS product. I manage a team of 40+ people directly and 70+ indirectly. Also, I am always brainstorming on new business ideas, product extensions, and the general state of the startup arena. 

Currently, I work at [IRIS Business Services](http://www.irisbusiness.com){:target="_blank"}, as the Product Manager for the company's premier cloud-based regulatory compliance platform - [Carbon](http://www.irisbusiness.com/carbon/en-us/){:target="_blank"} since 2014. I was a partner at [Dexter Consultancy](http://www.dexteronweb.com){:target="_blank"} (a market research and tech startup) for 4.5 years. I have worked with [Cognizant Tech.](http://www.cognizant.com/){:target="_blank"} in the past, and more recently for [SNL Financial](http://www.snl.com/){:target="_blank"} (acquired by S&P Capital IQ now). 

My personal projects in progress include <a href="http://beta.mylilac.in" target="_blank">Lilac - Pinterest for Shoppers</a> (currently in beta), with Deepa Anurag and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-rathi-601257b" target="_blank">Abhishek Rathi</a> as co-founders. Another project which I am helping on is <a href="http://www.schemopedia.org" target="_blank">Schemopedia</a> (POC stage), a venture focusing on enhancing broader citizen outreach for government benefits.

I have 9+ years of product and project management experience, with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from the Nirma Institute of Technology, Ahmedabad, batch of 2006. I am a technologist at heart, integration is what I absolutely love - taking practices from different apps or domains and applying them. I have basic coding chops, advanced product definition expertise, intermediate customer research and customer development skills.
